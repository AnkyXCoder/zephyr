  BQ25601 targets 1-Cell 3-A Buck Battery Charger for High Input Voltage and
  NVDC Power Path Management

  This charger is represented by device tree child node, e.g:

  charger: bq25601@6b {
      compatible = "ti,bq25601";
      reg = <0x6b>;
      status = "okay";

      constant-charge-current-max-microamp = <1000000>;
      constant-charge-voltage-max-microvolt = <4352000>;
      system-voltage-min-threshold-microvolt = <3500000>;
  };

include: [battery.yaml, i2c-device.yaml]

compatible: "ti,bq25601"

properties:
  constant-charge-current-max-microamp:
    required: true
    description: |
      The charge current target for the constant current phase of the charge profile.
      This value will be set at initialization time. Range: 100 mA to 3200 mA.
      The value specified will be rounded down to the closest implemented value.

  constant-charge-voltage-max-microvolt:
    required: true
    description: |
      The voltage regulation target for the constant voltage phase of the battery charging profile.
      This value will be set at initialization time. Range: 3.856 V to 4.624 V.
      The value specified will be rounded down to the closest implemented value.

  system-voltage-min-threshold-microvolt:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Minimum system voltage.
      Voltage that will be set above when the system voltage drops this level.
      This value will be set at initialization time. Range: 2.6 V to 3.7 V.
      The value specified will be rounded down to the closest implemented value.
